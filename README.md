# Neel's Dotfiles
Hello, my name is Neel and these are my dotfiles.

## Documentation
I really need to consolidate all the various heading documentation snippets I've scattered throughout this repo into an orgnaized personal knowledge base of sorts. Mostly for my own reference though.

Sorry if any comments or docs you find in these files are going straight over your head... because honestly, same. A lot of the time, it takes me a moment to re-interpret whatever information I attempted to capture in the margins.
