# ~/.defaults (macOS)
#
#   Store of macOS' settings hidden behind "defaults" CLI
#
#   These "non-default defaults" configs aren't really here to
#   be used or accessed programatically, but rather just for
#   documentation and reference purposes. I figured I should
#   start writing down all the minor little switches I have, or
#   in the future, will flip here and there so I know what my
#   personal "defaults" are that I've come to expect.
#
#   I guess these are just shell commands and executing this
#   file would just revert back any deviated settings. So I
#   added a bash shebang up top but haven't added +x bit to
#   avoid accidental executions.
#
#   Note: I didn't realize that the concept of this kind of
#   macos specific dotfile was sort of a niche thing until
#   after learning that some folks have been documenting and
#   uncovering a lot of these `defaults` and related swithes
#   embedded in the OS. Credit and thanks to Mathias Bynens
#   from whose dotfiles repo I discovered many of the below
#   tricks and configs (see https://mths.be/macos for ref)!
