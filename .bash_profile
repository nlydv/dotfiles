# shellcheck shell=bash
#
# ~/.bash_profile (macOS)
#
#   Bash startup file for interactive login shells.
#   So basically I gather that you ought to use this startup
#   script to hold extra commands that you'd want only login
#   shells specifically to run in addition to everything in
#   ~/.bashrc (by sourcing .bashrc from here also).
