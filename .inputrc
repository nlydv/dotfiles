# or may not actually be case insensitive though, look into this)
set completion-ignore-case on

# If command completion invoked by <TAB> results in multiple potential
# matches, immediately print out list instead of requiring double <TAB>

# Display possible completions using different colors to indicate their
# file type and disable appending / to directory completions since not
# necessary. The color definitions are taken from the value of $LS_COLORS
