As long as you retain this notice you can do whatever you want with this stuff. If we meet some day, and you found my stuff to be useful, you may or may not be morally obligated to buy me a beer in return.

My stuff is provided as is and I am not liable for problems you have involving my stuff. If we meet some day, and you found my stuff to be more problematic than useful and was reponsible for significant issues or complications you encountered, I may or may not be morally obligated to buy you a beer in return.
