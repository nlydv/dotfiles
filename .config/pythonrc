# ~/.config/pythonrc
#
#   A simple python interpreter config file that enables
#   tab completion and moves the interactive REPL command
#   history file from the default location ~/.python_history
#   to a dedicated history directory I started using at
#   ~/.history/python_history. This file's path needs to be
#   exported in the $PYTHONSTARTUP env var (e.g in ~/.bashrc
#   or similar shell startup file).
#
#   I don't actually use or know much python myself and these
#   commands seemed to be commonly recommended based off a
#   quick google search.
